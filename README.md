### Description

*MultiPy* is an interactive game designed for learning multiplication up to 10. The game consists of five levels, each with five questions, and offers three difficulty levels. It generates random questions, tracks player scores, and ranks them on a leaderboard at the end of the game. 
It's implemented in Python, using Tkinter and ttkbootstrap for the graphical user interface.
The main challenge was implementing Tkinter using an object-oriented approach, following the MVC concept. 
The next upgrade will include adding sound effects, expanding the game to include division operations, and possibly addition and subtraction as well.

### Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Tkinter library installed (install using pip).
Ttkbootstrap library installed (install using pip).

### Installation
Install the Tkinter module and the ttkbootstrap module.
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
The root file is `project.py`.

### Gameplay
"When the game starts, the main page is displayed. The main page shows a rank table featuring the best players, as well as buttons for `Start Game` and `Quit Game`."
